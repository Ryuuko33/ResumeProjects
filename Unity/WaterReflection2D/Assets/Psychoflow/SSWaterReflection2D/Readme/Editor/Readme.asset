    heading: Getting Started
    text: "Welcome to SS Water Relfection 2D! This is a simple tool to implement
      water reflection for 2D games. \r\n\"SS\" stands for Screen Space. It also
      can stand for Sprite Self. They are two different types of water reflection
      for various situations.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of sample scenes below that
      show the possibilities with SSWR2D:\r\n1. \"Styles\": It's a overall demonstration
      for the visual styles of water.\r\n\r\n2. \"Orthographic 2D\": It's a sample
      for orthographic 2d platformer game. It also contains the \"Refraction\" feature
      to hide underwater level.\r\n\r\n3. \"Perspective 2D\": It's a sample for perspective
      2d platformer game which supports parallax scrolling natively. It also contains
      the \"Sprite Self Reflection\" feature to reflect foreground objects.\r\n\r\n4.
      \"Top-down RPG\": It's a sample for Top-down view or RpgMaker-like games. It's
      also a good example for \"Sprite Self Reflection\" and how to write C# script
      with it.\r\n\r\n5. \"Fake 3D\": It's a sample for faking the 3D water plane
      with SSWR2D.\r\n\r\n6. \"Logo Scene\": Just a logo scene."
